Xcode creates the libXOPSupport.a file in the build/Debug directory
or build/Release directory if you build the release configuration.

The version shipped with the XOP Toolkit is the release configuration.

The sample XOP projects look for libXOPSupport.a in the project directory
(the parent of the build directory - named Xcode in the sample projects).
Thus after rebuilding the library, you must move the libXOPSupport.a file
from the build/Debug or build/Release directory to the Xcode directory.

As shipped from WaveMetrics, the XOPSupport library created by this project targets
Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
